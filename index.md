## About me

My name is Andrey and I'm 23 and I currently live in Borisov, Belarus. I studied at Belarusian State Technological University, faculty of information technology and graduated from it in 2017. I made my thesis software by using C#, so I decided to continue improving my coding skills with this programming language. 


### Interests

My personal interests are:
 - **Coding.** I really like creating desktop applications via C# Win Forms or WPF, and the most thing I enjoy about this is my perseverance to find a way to solve this or that issue that happens by coding process.
 -	*Learning English from foreing movies, music, videogames*
 -	*Playing videogames with my friends*

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/OliCyrus/olicyrus.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
