## About me

My name is Andrey and I'm 23 and I currently live in Borisov, Belarus. I studied at Belarusian State Technological University, faculty of information technology and graduated from it in 2017. I made my thesis software by using C#, so I decided to continue improving my coding skills with this programming language. 


## Interests

My personal interests are:
 - **Coding.** I really like creating desktop applications via C# Win Forms or WPF, and the most thing I enjoy about this is my perseverance to find a way to solve this or that issue that happens by coding process.
 -	**English.** I think English is not a privilege, but a necessity. I like to learn it from foreign movies, music, video games and other entertainment stuff. Still I seek experience to speak my mind freely.
 -	**Video games.** Spending time playing video games with my friends is what I'm fond of. I hope someday I will get a chance to take look at game development process which is very exciting too.
